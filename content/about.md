I’m Riccardo, a Software Engineer working fully remote for [ShippyPro](hhttps://www.shippypro.com) (Florence, Italy).

I have done front-end work in HTML, CSS, JQuery, Angular, Vue; Back-end web in Spring Boot, Laravel, CodeIgniter;
Database/server management in Hibernate, Eloquent, JPA, MongoDB; Devops in Docker, Google Cloud.

I am always experimenting, always learning, and never bored.

Out of the office you’ll find me kitesurfing, taking photos and petting all the good dogs (or cats ngl).
