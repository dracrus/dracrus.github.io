title: "About me"
---

I’m Riccardo, a Software Engineer working fully remote at [ShippyPro](https://www.shippypro.com) (Florence, Italy).

Throughout my career, I've dabbled in a wide array of technologies and platforms, always keeping things interesting and constantly learning. My development journey has taken me through various domains, and I've had the opportunity to work on both front-end and back-end technologies.

**Frontend:** I've crafted user interfaces with HTML, styled them with CSS, added interactive elements with Javascript, and explored the powerful worlds of Angular and Vue to build dynamic and responsive web applications.

**Backend:** When it comes to server-side development, I've worked with frameworks like Spring Boot, Laravel, and CodeIgniter. These tools have allowed me to create robust and efficient back-end systems that power web applications.

**DevOps:** I'm not just about coding; I've also dived into the DevOps realm, utilizing Docker and harnessing the power of AWS, Google Cloud and Serverless technologies to ensure seamless deployment and efficient management of applications

I consider myself a perpetual explorer of the tech landscape. There's always something new to discover, an innovative approach to try, or a problem to solve, which keeps me engaged, curious, and, most importantly, never bored.

Out of the office you’ll find me kitesurfing, taking photos and petting all the good dogs (or cats ngl).
