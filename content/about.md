I’m Riccardo, a Software Engineer working remotely for [Relatech](https://www.relatech.com/) (Milan, Italy).

I have done front-end work in HTML, CSS, JQuery, Angular; Back-end web in Spring Boot, Laravel, CodeIgniter;
Database/server management in Hibernate, Eloquent, JPA; Devops in Docker, Google Cloud.

I am always experimenting, always learning, and never bored.

Out of the office you’ll find me dreaming of kitesurf, taking photos and petting all the good dogs.
