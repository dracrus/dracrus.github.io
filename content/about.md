title: "About me"
---

I’m Riccardo, a Software Engineer working remotely for [Relatech](https://www.relatech.com/) (Milan, Italy).

I specialize in building applications specific to the business needs of my clients. I have done work in front-end in
HTML, CSS, JQuery, Angular, back-end web in Spring Boot and Laravel, database/server management and video game
development with Unity in my free time.

I am always experimenting, always learning, and never bored.

Out of the office you’ll find me dreaming of kitesurf, taking photos and petting all the good dogs.
